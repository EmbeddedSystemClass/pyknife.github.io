# Force control of a robotic leg using a virtual model
A robust robotic leg platform and testing rig capable of rapid acceleration and high fidelity force control experimentation, developed for the UCT Mechatronics Lab in partial fulfillment of the academic requirements for a Bachelor of Science (Eng.) degree in Mechatronics. The thesis report can be found at: http://www.benjaminscholtz.com/blog/pdfs/thesis-report-final.pdf  

**Research Questions**:
1. Is a virtual model a suitable replacement for accurate dynamic modelling in complex robotic topologies? 
2. Can high fidelity force control be effectively implemented without using force Feedback?
3. Is a virtual compliance control system effective in handling high speed impacts and executing rapid acceleration manoeuvres?
